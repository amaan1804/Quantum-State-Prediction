# Quantum-State-Prediction
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine  learning algorithms to accurately predict the quantum state  of a particle in a box quantum system based on input  features such as position (x), wavefunction (ψ(x)), Eigen  Energy (Eₙ), and probability density (|ψ(x)|²).
