# Quantum-State-Prediction
The main objective of this project is to leverage machine  learning algorithms to accurately predict the quantum state  of a particle in a box quantum system based on input  features such as position (x), wavefunction (ψ(x)), Eigen  Energy (Eₙ), and probability density (|ψ(x)|²).

# Background  
Quantum mechanics, a fundamental theory in physics, describes the behaviour of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. The quantum state of a system, represented by a wavefunction, encapsulates critical information about the system's properties, such as energy levels, probabilities of various outcomes, 
and observable quantities. 
In recent years, the intersection of quantum mechanics and machine learning has emerged as a promising field. Machine learning techniques offer powerful tools for analyzing complex data, making predictions, and uncovering patterns that may not be immediately apparent through traditional methods. This synergy has opened new avenues for tackling challenging problems in quantum physics, including the prediction of quantum states. 

# Problem Statement  
The prediction of quantum states is a crucial aspect of quantum mechanics with applications across various domains. However, it is often a computationally intensive and mathematically complex task. Traditional methods rely on analytical solutions or numerical simulations, which may be limited in their scalability or accuracy, especially for highly complex quantum systems. 
The challenge lies in developing robust and efficient methods for predicting quantum states that can handle large datasets, account for quantum uncertainties, and provide accurate results across different scenarios. Machine learning offers a promising approach by leveraging algorithms that can learn from data, extract patterns, and generalize to make predictions about quantum states.
